Welcome to my personal blog where I will be uploading new articles about tech, programming and the world today.
Writting this blog is a way to share my knowledge and experiences with you. I hope you find it useful and interesting.

At the moment im trying to learn new languages such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
Thats why I decided to create this blog, to share my experiences and knowledge with you. Most posts will contain code with this three mentioned languages.

Every day you learn something new! Good development!

```rust title='welcome.rs'
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
