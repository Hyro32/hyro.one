# Welcome to mardroide.dev

## Who am I?

Hello everybody! My name is Marcos, better known as Mardroide and sometimes as mrcxs. I'm an information systems engineering student and developer. Currently 18 years old and based in Spain.

My goal as a programmer, is the creation of an organization or group aimed at creating open source code for the community. In short, a place where all people from everywhere can collaborate to make this world a little bit better.

Here are some of my most used social networks:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrcxs86)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Mardroide)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/4WV4Ys65x7)
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mrcxs)

## What do I do?

Currently my programming background is focused on web development. However, I also dedicate some time to the development of plugins and packages for other areas.

- [Spheal Hub](https://github.com/sphealhub): an open source GitHub organization.
