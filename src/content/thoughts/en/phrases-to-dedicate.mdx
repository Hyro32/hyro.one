Every time I see you, I fall in love all over again.

It feels like our souls,
met thousands of years ago,
because our souls,
connected effortlessly,
like we already knew each other.

I've made a home in you
in the way that you smell
in the way that you taste
in the way that you feel
when they ask me,
where home is,
i always think of you.
