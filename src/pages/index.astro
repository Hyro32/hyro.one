    <p>
      I am a student of Systems Engineering at the University of Alcal√°. I love
      programming and learning new things. I am currently learning new languages
      such as rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my dreams is to create a community of programmers who share their
      knowledge and experiences. Creating new projects, contributing and sharing
      knowledge is what motivates me to move forward.
